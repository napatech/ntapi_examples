BUFFER PROFILING TOOL:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:
    Often when packet drops occur it is difficult to fully understand the 
    conditions that lead up to the drop.

    This program will track port, buffer and CPU utilization and monitor for
    packet loss.  When dropped packets are detected information about the state
    of the system is output every second; starting five seconds prior to the drop
    and continuing until no more drops are detected.



Usage:
  Syntax:
    bufferProfile [--help] [-h] [-f] [-d] [-k] [-c]
  
  Optional Arguments:
    -f <filename>   : Name of file where update will be output.  This is a 
                      : required option when running as a daemon
    -c              : Continuous operation.  This option will output statistics
                      : every second regardless of whether drops have occured.
    -d              : Run this program as a daemon.  The -f <filename> option
                      : must be specified when running as a daemon
    -k              : Kill a running daemon instance.
    --help, -h      : Displays the help.;


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example Output:

Below is an example of the data that is output.  This will be output once per 
second, beginning five seconds prior to the drop, when drops are detected.  Or, 
when running in continuous mode, this will be output once per second regardless
of whether drops occur.  

These entries are:

Ports:

    Mbps: the throughput of the traffic that is being received on each port.

Streams:
    pkts: The number of packets received on each stream during in the past second.

    Gbps: The throughput rate on each stream during the past second.

    hbuffUtil: The average utilization (percentage used) of the host buffers for 
               each stream during the past second.

    sdramUtil: The average utilization (percentage used) of the on-board SDRAM 
               for each stream during the past second.

    pktsDrop:  The number of packets dropped for each stream during the past second.

CPU:

    utilization:  The average utilization of each CPU core during the past second.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example Usage:

    When run without any arguments usage statistics will be output to the terminal
    display only when drops are detected:

        bufferProfile

    The following will continuously output usage statistics to the terminal display
    whether or not drops are occuring:

        bufferProfile -c

    The following is the most common usage.  This will run the tool in daemon mode and output 
    data to a file only when drops are detected:

        bufferProfile -d -f <filename>
