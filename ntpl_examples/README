- IPv6
    - traffic file: ./pcap/IPv6.pcap

    - examples:

       - IPv6.ntpl: filter on a single IPv6 address using the Key Matcher

       - IPv6_range.ntpl: filter on a range of IPv6 addresses using the Key Matcher

       - IPv6_mask.ntpl: filter on an IPv6 subnet using a mask with the Key Matcher

    - notes:

        - all of these examples will pass 75 of the 161 packets in the pcap file

        - notice how the CAM and TCAM usages changes when using a single address vs. a range or mask


- VxLAN
    - traffic file: ./pcap/VxLAN_4vni.pcap

    - examples:

        - VxLAN_decap_2host.ntpl: decapsulates VxLAN packets and delivers inner packets to the host.

        - VxLAN_decap_2ReTx.ntpl: decapsulates and retransmits inner packets out ports [0..3] based 
          on vni field of VxLAN header as follows:
              vni == 1 -> port 0
              vni == 2 -> port 1
              vni == 3 -> port 2
              vni == 4 -> port 3

        - VxLAN_decap_2host_2ReTx.ntpl: decapsulates VxLAN packets and delivers inner packets to host 
          and also retransmits the packets.  Packets are delivered to ports and streams as follows:
              vni == 1 -> stream 0 -> port 0
              vni == 2 -> stream 1 -> port 1
              vni == 3 -> stream 2 -> port 2
              vni == 4 -> stream 3 -> port 3


- ReTx

    - traffic file: any

    - examples:

        - ReTx.ntpl: retransmits all packets arriving on port 0 to port 1 and visa versa

	- ReTx_and_deliver_2host.ntpl: Similar to ReTx.ntpl, but also delivers traffic from port 0 to stream 0 
          and traffic from port 1 to stream 1

- remove_outer_IP-GRE_headers

    - traffic file: ./pcap/gre-sample.pcap

    - examples:

        - remove_outer_IP-GRE_headers.ntpl: removes the outer IPv4 and GRE (UDP) protocol layers leaving a 
          packet consisting of the original ethernet header combined with the inner packet's protocols
