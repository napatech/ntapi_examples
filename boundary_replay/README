The boundary_replay tool replays a PCAP file repeating every 10 mSec.
The packets will be transmitted starting at each 10 mSec boundary of
the adapter's clock (which in turn can be synchronized to an external
time server) with the IFG of each packets determined precisely by the
timestamps in the PCAP file.\n"
